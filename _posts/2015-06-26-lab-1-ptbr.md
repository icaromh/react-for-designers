Eu também ouvi que React.js era bom e recentemente gastei algum tempo brincando com ele. Agora que eu estou bastante confortável com React decidi escrever um tutorial sobre esse assunto.

## Audiência Alvo: Pessoas que já sabem o suficiente de jQuery para sobreviver

Antes de começar, eu gostaria de esclarecer quem são meus alvos de audiência.

Zed Shaw, o autor da série "[Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/)", recentemente escreveu um excelente blog post chamado [Early v.s. Beginning Coders](http://zedshaw.com/2015/06/16/early-vs-beginning-coders/). Em seu post Zed critica professores de programação que fizem que seus materiais são para "novatos" mas na verdade são incompreensíveis pela "total" maioria de iniciantes.

Eu não quero cometer erros similares aqui. De pessoas que nunca tentaram React, algumas estão confortáveis com frameworks frontend como [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/) ou [Angular](https://angularjs.org/). Algumas sabem JavaScript muito bem. Algumas sabem o suficiente de jQuery para sobreviver. Um tutorial que é efetivo para um grupo deve não ser otimizado para outros grupos.

Nesse tutorial, eu estou mirando no terceiro grupo que mencionei: **Pessoas que sabem o suficiente de jQuery para sobreviver**. Exemplos de pessoas que talvez se encaixem nessa categoria podem ser:

- Designers que conseguem fazer o básico de código em HTML/CSS/jQuery
- Desenvolvedores em WordPRess que sabem como usar plugins jQuery.
- Desenvolvedores iniciantes que completaram tutoriais online básicos de HTML/CSS/JS.
- Desenvolvedores Backend que dependem do Boostrap e básico de jQuery para suas necessidades frontend.
- Anyone who does more copy-pasting than architecting when it comes to JavaScript.

**Se você está confortável com Javascrupt ou qualquer outro framework frontend como Backbone/Ember/Angular esse tutorial NÃO é para você**, e você vai ficar bastante frustrado com meu estilo de escrita. Há toneladas de ótimos tutoriais onde você pode aprender, incluindo [o tutorial oficial de React.js](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)..

Também, **se você já conhece React**, você vai ficar muito bastante chateado comigo as well because I'll be talking mostly about states instead of immutability or componetization. Entretanto, eu achei que ensinar estados primeiro é o melhor jeito para desenvolvedores jQuery para ver porquê Reack é superior.

De qualquer forma, vamos começar!

## Tempo Estimado: 1 ~ 2 horas

Se você for realmente rápido (e copiar-colar os códigos de exemplo, ao invés de digitar), esse tutorial deve levar um pouco menos de uma hora. Se você for devagar, deve levar um pouco menos de duas horas.

### Se você está preso

Se você está preso, faça algo a seguir:

- Comente na caixa de comentários bem no final dessa página.
- Me mande um email em [shu@chibicode.com](mailto:shu@chibicode.com).
- Me envie um Tweet em [@chibicode](http://twitter.com/chibicode).
- Crie uma issue [neste repositório](https://github.com/reactfordesigners/reactfordesigners.github.io/issues).

### Nota: O botão de voltar do seu navegador pode quebrar.

Esse parece ser um problema com essa página, onde (1) o navegador constantemente recarrega ele mesmo enquanto está visualizando essa página, e (2) como um resultado, o botão de voltar do seu navegador quebra. Esse parece ser um problema no código do JSBin, que eu estou usando, e [eu reportei esse problema aqui]((https://github.com/jsbin/jsbin/issues/2464)). Minhas desculpas.

## Overview: Nós vamos construir um "Tweet Box"

Muitos tutoriais de React.js começam explicando como React trabalho ou porque React é demais. O meu tutorial não.

Ao invés disso, nós vamos começar construindo uma interface simples, alternando entre implementações em jQuery e implementações em React.js, explicando as diferenças ao longo do caminho. Eu acredito que você vai pensar mais dessa forma do que ficar simplesmente escrevendo exemplos.

A interface que vamos construir vai assemelhar-se ao Tweet box que você encontra no [Twitter](https://twitter.com). Não será exatamente igual ao Tweet box real, mas vai ser bem semelhando. Esperamos que você ache esse exemplo seja prático.

![](/content/images/2015/08/tweet-box.png)

## Passo 1: Introdução ao JSBin (5 - 10 minutos)

Nós usaremos o [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/), um editor online de HTML/CSS/JS que suporta tanto códigos jQuery quanto React.js. Talvez vocês esteja familiarizado com alguns serviços como [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) ou [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) - eles são muito parecitos, então eu decidi ir de JSBin.

Aqui um exemplo com JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/temaduv/1/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/temaduv/1/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
<script src="https://static.jsbin.com/js/embed.min.js?3.34.2"></script>
</p>

**Tente modificar o HTML na esquerda** - por exemplo, mude o texto do botão. Você vai ver a alteração na direita. É assim que o JSBin funciona.

### Crie uma conta no JSBin

A menos que você já possua uma conta no JSBin, <strong>vá para <a href="http://jsbin.com/" target="_blank">jsbin.com</a> para criar uma conta.</strong> Clique em **Login or Register** no menu para criar uma conta.

Depois de criar uma conta, você pode **clonar** publicamente JSBins para sua conta, assim como você pode clonar repositórios públicos no GitHub.

Vamos tentar. **Clique em "Save" no menu no JSBin a seguir**.

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/temaduv/1/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/temaduv/1/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

Uma vez que estiver no site JSBin, você pode selecionar "Add Library" no menu para importar bibliotecas populares de CSS/JS.

![](/content/images/2015/08/add-library.png)

**Tente fazer isso a seguir**:

- **Clique em "Add Library" e adicione a última versão do Bootstrap**
- **Adicione as classes `btn btn-primary` no `<button>`**

E a saida ser tornará um pouco mais bonita:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/cocica/1/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/cocica/1/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

### Cria uma Tweet Box

Você parece estar bem confortável com JSBin agora. Tudo bem, vamos contruir uma Tweet box. Ainda no mesmo JSBin como antes, **mude o HTML dentro do `<body>` assim:**


```
<div class="well clearfix">
  <textarea class="form-control"></textarea><br/>
  <button class="btn btn-primary pull-right">Tweet</button>
</div>
```

Nós estamos usando classes do Bootstrap como `form-control`, `well`, `clearfix`, etc., mas elas são apenas para a aparência e irrelevantes para o tutorial. Aqui está o resultado:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/jofivi/1/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/jofivi/1/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

E é isso para esse passo! Nada mal, não é?

## Passo 2: Implementar a primeira feature - Botão de Tweet deve inicialmente ser desabilitado (5 minutos)

Agora, hora para algum javascript. Nós vamos primeiro implementar a seguinte feature:

**Feature 1:** o botão "Tweet" deve inicialmente ser desabilitado. Quando houver ao menos um caracter no campo de texto, o botão "Tweet" deve ser habilitado.

Aqui está a demonstração. Como você pode ver, o botão é inicialmente desabilitado . Se você escrever algo na caixa de texto, o botão se torna habilitado.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/2/embed?output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a> <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>


Para fazer isso, **continue a partir do JSBin anterior, abra a aba JavaScript, e adicione o código jQuery a seguir**. Você não precisa adicionar jQuery porque o Bootstrap, que nós adicionamos no passo anterior já inclui a jQuery.


```
// Botão inicialmente desabilitado
$("button").prop("disabled", true);

// Quando o valor do textarea muda...
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  // Se existe ao menos um caracter...
  if ($(this).val().length > 0) {
    // Habilita o botão.
    $("button").prop("disabled", false);
  } else {
    // Senão, desabilita o botão.
    $("button").prop("disabled", true);
  }
});
```

### Explicação

- Eu usei as tags, `button` e `textarea`, como seletores, não é necessário adicionar IDs/classes para esse evento trivial.
- Para habilitar/desabilitar o botão, use `$(...).prop(disabled, ...)`. 
- Para escutar as mudanças 
- To listen for the changes in `textarea`, use the `input` event, which works on modern browsers.

**Try it out** by typing some text in the Tweet box and seeing the button's enabled/disabled state change.

DO NOT PROCEED if this example was confusing to you - you might need to learn some more jQuery before moving onto React. There are lots of excellent learning resources like [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/jquery), [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/jquery-basics), [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery), and others.

Now that this feature is complete, we'll try to re-implement the same thing using React. This will take several steps.

## Step 3: The Tweet Box Using React.js (5 - 10 minutes)

One of the first things you'll notice in React is that **you'll be writing markup in JS, not in HTML**.

Let me show you what I mean. Here's the React.js code which displays the same Tweet box.

### WARNING! You don't need to follow along yet - just read the code.

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/6/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/6/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

Some observations:

- Inside `return (...)` is HTML code, not JavaScript. In React, you'll write in a special syntax called JSX, which lets you put HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
- I say HTML-"like" because it's not identical to HTML. Notice that it uses `className` instead of `class` - but they're pretty similar, so you'll learn them quickly.
- Your browser does not understand JSX, so when React processes your JSX code, it automatically converts the HTML part inside JSX into valid JavaScript code so that the browser can understand it.
- The HTML code inside `return (...)` is pretty much identical to the HTML code from step 1.
- Try clicking on "HTML" on the above JSBin, and you'll see that there's no markup in HTML besides `<body></body>`. This is what I mean when I said **in React, you'll be writing markup in JavaScript (JSX), not in HTML**.

### Frequently Asked Questions & Answers

**Question**: What do `React.createClass` and `React.render` do? Do I need to understand them now? <br>
**Answer**: Don't worry about it for now. Basically, `React.createClass` creates a piece of UI with a name (in this case, `TweetBox`). This then gets attached to the DOM through `React.render(<TweetBox />, document.body)` - meaning this UI is added inside the `body` tag. That's all you need to know for now.

**Question**: Do I need to do anything special to write JSX on my local machine?<br>
**Answer**: Yes, but that's outside the scope of this tutorial - in short, you need to import something called JSX transformer (<a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html" target="_blank">here's how</a>). This step is not necessary on JSBin though. All you need to do to write JSX on JSBin is to (1) add a React library (the one without addons) from the dropdown and (2) select "JSX (React)" from the dropdown menu on the JS view.

**Question**: Isn't it a bad style to write markup (HTML) and behavior (JS) in the same place?<br>
**Answer**: It might be a bad style for simple web pages, but not necessarily so for large web applications. In large web applications, there will be hundreds of pieces of UI, each containing its own markup and behavior. The code will be more manageable if those markup and behavior are kept together for each piece of UI, as opposed to keeping "all markups" together and "all behaviors" together. And React is designed for developing large web applications. In fact, React was actually created and used by Facebook, one of the largest web applications ever.

Next, I'll show you how to write the above React code step-by-step.

## Step 4: Writing Your First React.js Code (5 - 10 minutes)

I created a starter HTML file for you. Using "Add library," I've imported Bootstrap (removed bootstrap.js and jquery) and React (without addons).

 **Please try to follow along. To begin, click "Save" to copy this to your JSBin.**

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/notawe/1/embed?html">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a> <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/notawe/1/edit">Clnotaick here</a>.</span>


After saving to your JSBin, **open the JavaScript tab and select "JSX (React)"**:

![](/content/images/2015/08/select-jsx.png)

Now you're ready to write some React. **Try to follow along and type the following JS code snippets** on your JSBin.

```
var TweetBox = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
  }
});
```

This is the template for creating a piece of UI using React (in this case, a Tweet box). It's just as essential as `$(function() { ... })` on jQuery.

To actually construct the UI, we must fill in the `render()` method. For now, let's keep it simple with just a single `div` tag.

```
var TweetBox = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      <div>
        Hello World!
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

Like the above example, **put a pair of parenthesis `(...)` after `return`, and write the markup inside.**

### JSX Gotchas

There's one thing you need to remember with JSX - on `render()`, there must be exactly **one** outer-most tag inside `return (...)`.

So the following doesn't work because there's zero outer-most tag:

```
return (
  Hello World!
);
```

This also doesn't work because there are two outer-most (`span`) tags inside `return (...)`:

```
return (
  <span>
    Hello
  </span>
  <span>
    World
  </span>
);
```

For the above example, the workaround is to create an extra tag which wraps the two `span` tags. I just used `div` here. This is a necessary evil when using React.

```
return (
  <div>
    <span>
      Hello
    </span>
    <span>
      World
    </span>
  </div>
);
```

### Attaching the UI to the DOM

Now we need to "attach" this UI to the DOM in order to see `Hello World`. To do this, **add `React.render()` below the code we just wrote**:

```
var TweetBox = React.createClass({
  ...
});

React.render(
  <TweetBox />,
  document.body
);
```

(**Note**: an ellipsis (`...`) on the code snippet indicates code that has been omitted for clarity. In other words, don't touch this part of the code and leave it as is.)

`React.render` takes two arguments. The first argument is the UI object, which is `<VariableName />`. The second argument is the DOM object (in this case, `document.body`). Put together, the above code renders the `TweetBox` UI inside `body`.

Now, you should see `Hello World` appear on your JSBin. Congratulations, you wrote your first React UI!

### Write the Actual HTML for the Tweet Box

Now, instead of `Hello World`, we'll implement the HTML for the Tweet Box. **Swap the code inside `render()` with this:**

```
return (
  <div className="well clearfix">
    <textarea className="form-control"></textarea>
    <br/>
    <button className="btn btn-primary pull-right">Tweet</button>
  </div>
);
```

There are two things you need to watch out for:

- **Do not use `class`**. Instead, use `className`. It's because JSX gets translated to JS, and `class` is a keyword in the newest version of JS.
- **If you use `<br>` instead of `<br/>`, it won't work.** Make sure to put `/` on self-closing tags.

Everything else should be the same with the jQuery example from before.

If you typed this correctly, then you should see the Tweet box on your JSBin. **If nothing appears in the output, then check your code very carefully, to make sure there aren't any typos.**

That's it for this step! Here's the JSBin up to this part:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/vajica/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/vajica/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

## Step 5: Re-implement the First Feature - Tweet Button Should Initially Be Disabled - in React (5 - 10 minutes)

We're going to re-implement in React the first feature we implemented using jQuery:

**Feature 1**: the "Tweet" button should initially be disabled. When there's at least one character in the text field, the "Tweet" button should be enabled.

Here's the jQuery code we wrote:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/3/edit?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/3/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

Let's see how we can do this in React.

**Start with the JSBin from the previous step.** (**Tip**: Since you won't be touching HTML in React, **you can close the HTML tab on JSBin** so you can get more screen space).

**First, let's disable the button by adding `disabled`.**

```
render: function() {
  return (
    ...
    <button className="..." disabled>Tweet</button>
    ...
  );
}
```

Then the button should now be disabled. Note that in our jQuery implementation we wrote:

```
$("button").prop("disabled", true);

```

to initially disable the button, but we could have instead modified the `button` tag like above.

Now, we need to enable the button when there's at least one character in the text field.

### Handle Change Event

First, we need to wait when users enter the text. In our jQuery implementation, we wrote:

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  ...
}
```

In the React land, we write the event handler as a **method**. **Let's call it `handleChange`**:

```
React.createClass({
  handleChange: function(event) {
  },
  render: function() {
    ...
  }
});
```

Next, we invoke this handler when text is entered. To do so, **modify the `textarea` tag in `render()` like this**:

```
<textarea className="form-control"
          onChange={this.handleChange}></textarea>
```

- We used `input` event for jQuery, but in React we use `onChange` - you'll learn about how events differ in React's JSX from React's documentation, so don't worry too much now.
- **More importantly**, we use `{...}` syntax to include any JavaScript code inside the HTML syntax part of JSX. In this case, we want to pass the handler `handleChange`, and we prefix it with `this.` because it's a method on this UI object.
- If you're used to jQuery, this might seem like a bad practice, but don't worry. Again, in large applications, the code will be more manageable if those markup and behaviors are kept together for each piece of UI.

To make sure that the handler is indeed being called, **let's add `console.log` inside `handleChange`**:

```
handleChange: function(event) {
  console.log(event.target.value);
},
```

The `event` object contains `target`, which is the `textarea`. We use `.value` on it to output the current value of the `textarea`.

**In your JSBin, open the `console` tab to check the output. Then type something on the Tweet box.**

![](/images/labs/console-tab.png)

You can try it out here:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/kohudu/2/embed?javascript,console,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/kohudu/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

That's it for this step! We'll finish this feature on the next step.

**NOTE: Close the console tab on JSBin when you're done.** We no longer need it.

## Step 6: Implementing State (10 - 15 minutes)

I'll now explain one of the biggest differences between jQuery-style code and React.js-style code.

In jQuery, when some event happens, you usually change the DOM (like we did earlier):

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-1.png)

In React, **you don't directly modify the DOM**. Instead, in an event handler, you modify something called **the "state"**. And this is done by calling `this.setState`.

![](/images/labs/react-style-1.png)

Then, every time the state is updated, **`render()` is called again**. And **inside `render()` you can access the state**.

![](/images/labs/react-style-2.png)

This is how you update the UI in response to an event. Yes it's confusing, so let me explain using code.

### Writing the Event Handler

**Start with the JSBin from the previous step.** First, we need to **initialize the state object** - without this, nothing will work.

To do this, **we need to write a special method called `getInitialState` and have it return a JS object**, which becomes the initial state.

What goes in the object? **Let's create a single key called `text`** and have it store whatever is inside the Tweet box.

```
var TweetBox = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {
      text: ""
    };
  },
  handleChange: ...
  render: ...
});
```

**Next, we'll modify the event handler** to set the state's `text` field to whatever is currently in the text box. To do this, **we use a special built-in method called `setState` and pass the updated key-value pair.**

```
handleChange: function(event) {
  this.setState({ text: event.target.value });
},
```

Now, let's check that the state is correctly being set by writing some debug-only code in `render()`.

To do this, **simply add `this.state.text` near the end of `render()`, and use the `{ ... }` syntax** to call JS code inside the HTML syntax part of JSX.

```
render: function() {
  return (
    <div ...>
      ...
      <button ...>Tweet</button>

      <br/>
      {this.state.text}
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Now, try entering some text on the tweet box.** The same set of text should appear below the button.

You can try it out on the JSBin below as well:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/yabiqo/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/yabiqo/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

Now the previous diagram might make more sense to you.

![](/images/labs/react-style-2.png)

### Remove the Debugging Code

Once you confirm that the state is correctly being set, **remove the debugging code we just added:**

<div class="highlight"><pre><code style="text-decoration: line-through">&lt;br/&gt;
{this.state.text}
</code></pre></div>

### Enabling/Disabling the Button

Now that we can watch for the text changes, all that's left is to enable/disable the button depending on whether the text is entered.

Using the state, we can use this logic:

- If `this.state.text.length === 0`, then the button should be disabled.

To do this in React, **add `disabled` attribute, and set it with the return value of `this.state.text.length === 0`**. Since this is JS code, you need to wrap it with `{}`.

```
<button className="btn btn-primary pull-right"
        disabled={this.state.text.length === 0}>Tweet</button>
```

If you write `disabled="true"` or `disabled="false"` in raw HTML it won't work - in raw HTML, you need to remove the `disabled` attribute to enable the button. But React is **not** raw HTML - it does the following magic behind the scenes:

- If you do `disabled={true}` in JSX, it gets converted to just `<button ... disabled>` in HTML.
- If you do `disabled={false}` in JSX, the `disabled` attribute is removed from the `button` tag in HTML.

This works with other boolean attributes like `checked`. This is not officially documented as of writing, but it should be included soon.

The resulting JSBin is here:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/lutefu/3/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/lutefu/3/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

### Reflections

Again, keep this difference between jQuery and React in mind before moving onto the next step:

- In jQuery, you write event handlers which modify the **DOM**.
- In React.js, you write event handlers which modify the **state**. And you write `render()` to reflect the current state.

## Step 7: Remaining Character Count in jQuery (5 minutes)

The next feature we'll implement is the remaining character count.

![](/images/labs/tweet-box-character-count.png)

Here's the spec:

- The character count will display `140 - the number of characters entered`.

**We'll first implement this in jQuery, then in React.**

We'll start with our previous jQuery implementation. We'll put our React.js code on hold. **From now on, I will give you new code to start with at the beginning of each chapter**, as we alternate between jQuery and React. That means after you're done with each step, you can play with the code before moving to the next step.

<div class="message"><strong>✔ Click "Save" below</strong> to copy the code to your JSBin and get started.</div>

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/3/edit?html,js">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/3/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

First, **add character count in HTML using `span`**. Let's set it as `span`:

```
<textarea ...></textarea><br>
<span>140</span>
<button ...>Tweet</button>
```

And **inside the `input` handler in JS, add this code to update the character count**:

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  $("span").text(140 - $(this).val().length);
  ...
});
```

That's it! **Try typing in the Tweet box** and you'll see the character count update. Here's the JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/durima/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/durima/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

## Step 8: Remaining Character Count in React.js (5 minutes)

How about in React? You should try doing this on your own. Start with our previous React implementation.

<div class="message"><strong>✔ Click "Save" below</strong> to copy the code to your JSBin and get started.</div>

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/lutefu/3/embed?html,js">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/lutefu/3/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

(**Tip**: Since you won't be touching HTML in React, **you can close the HTML tab on JSBin** so you can get more screen space).

**Hint**:

- No need to change `getInitialState()` or `handleChange()`
- Use `this.state.text.length` in `render()`.

### Answer:

**Add this after `<br/>` in `render()`**:

```
<span>{140 - this.state.text.length}</span>
```

Here's the JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/lizoco/3/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/lizoco/3/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

Too easy? Not sure why React.js is so much better than jQuery? Well, the next step has more complexity, and this is when React.js really shines.

## Step 9: The "Add Photo" Button (5 minutes)

For our next feature, we'll add an "Add Photo" button to the UI. This is when things get tricky.

![](/images/labs/tweet-box-add-photo.png)

However, **we will not actually let users upload photos.** Instead, here's what we're going to do.

When you upload a photo on Twitter, it counts against the number of characters you can use. On my attempt, it decreased the number of remaining characters from 140 to 117:

![](/images/labs/tweet-box-add-photo-explanation.png)

So that's what we're going to do. Here's the spec:

- Create an "Add Photo" button.
- Clicking this button toggles the ON/OFF state. **If it's ON, the button will say `✓ Photo Added`.**
- If this button is ON, **the number of available characters decreases by 23.**
- Also, if this button is ON, **even if there's no text entered, the "Tweet" button remains enabled.**

Here's the demo JSBin. **Try clicking the "Add Photo" button** and see what happens to the character count and the Tweet button.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/sanuqi/2/embed?output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a> <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/sanuqi/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>

Let's implement this. We'll first try with jQuery.

## Step 10: The "Add Photo" Button, in jQuery (15 - 20 minutes)

Start with our previous jQuery implementation.

 <div class="message"><strong>✔ Click "Save" below</strong> to copy the code to your JSBin and get started.</div>

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/durima/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/durima/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

We'll modify both the HTML and JS. Before, we were attaching a handler to `$("button")`, but this won't work if there are two buttons. **So let's modify the HTML like this**:

```
...
<button class="js-tweet-button btn btn-primary pull-right" disabled>Tweet</button>
<button class="js-add-photo-button btn btn-default pull-right">Add Photo</button>
...
```

Here are the changes:

- **Added the second button** called "Add Photo".
- **Added classes `js-tweet-button` and `js-add-photo-button` to each button**. They're prefixed with `js-` because they are used only in JS and not in CSS.
- **Added the `disabled` attribute to the Tweet button** so I don't have to do this in JS.

**Next, rewrite the entire JS file like this:**

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  $("span").text(140 - $(this).val().length);

  if ($(this).val().length > 0) {
    $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", false);
  } else {
    $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", true);
  }
});
```

Here are the changes:

- **(Important) Removed `$("button").prop("disabled", true);` from the first line** because I added `disabled` attribute to the Tweet button,
- **Replaced `$("button")` with `$(".js-tweet-button")`** so it can be distinguished from `.js-add-photo-button`.

### Adding the Button

Next, we'll implement one of the features:

- Clicking the "Add Photo" button toggles the ON/OFF state. **If it's ON, the button will say `✓ Photo Added`.**

To do this, **let's add this piece of code**:

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  ...
});

$(".js-add-photo-button").on("click", function() {
  if ($(this).hasClass("is-on")) {
    $(this)
      .removeClass("is-on")
      .text("Add Photo");
  } else {
    $(this)
      .addClass("is-on")
      .text("✓ Photo Added");
  }
});
```

We use the class `is-on` to keep track of the state. **Check to see that this works** by clicking the "Add Photo" button multiple times and seeing the text alternate.

### Decrement Character Count

Next, we'll implement this feature:

- If the "Add Photo" button is ON, **the number of available characters decreases by 23.**

To do this, **modify the click handler we just added like this**.

```
if ($(this).hasClass("is-on")) {
  $(this)
    .removeClass("is-on")
    .text("Add Photo");
  $("span").text(140 - $("textarea").val().length);
} else {
  $(this)
    .addClass("is-on")
    .text("✓ Photo Added");
  $("span").text(140 - 23 - $("textarea").val().length);
}
```

We change `span`'s text on every click. If the button becomes ON, then we need to subtract the text length from 117, which is `140 - 23`. We use `140 - 23` for clarity now - eventually we should use constants.

**Check to see that this works** by clicking the "Add Photo" button.

### Fixing the Input Handler

This is not complete however - **if you have the "Add Photo" button ON and start typing on the text area, the remaining character count goes out of sync.**

To fix this, **we also need to update the input handler for `textarea`**:

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  if ($(".js-add-photo-button").hasClass("is-on")) {
    $("span").text(140 - 23 - $(this).val().length);
  } else {
    $("span").text(140 - $(this).val().length);
  }

  if (...) {
    ...
});
```

**Check to see that this works** by clicking the "Add Photo" button and typing some text.

### I know this is taking some time...

But stick with it! The jQuery code here is *supposed* to be confusing, so don't worry!

### Implement the Final Feature

The last feature we need to implement is this:

- If the "Add Photo" button is ON, **even if there's no text entered, the "Tweet" button remains enabled.**

To do this, **we need to modify the click handler of the "Add Photo" button:**

```
$(".js-add-photo-button").on("click", function() {
  if ($(this).hasClass("is-on")) {
    ...
    if ($("textarea").val().length === 0) {
      $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", true);
    }
  } else {
    ...
    $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", false);
  }
});
```

Here's the explanation:

- If the "Add Photo" button is going from ON to OFF (`if` clause), we need to check if there's no text entered and if so, disable the "Tweet" button.
- If the "Add Photo" button is going from OFF to ON (`else` clause), we always enable the "Tweet" button.

### But again, this is broken

**We're not done yet**. The following steps will break the code. **Try it out yourself**:

- Turn on the "Add Photo" button.
- Type some text.
- Delete all of the text.
- The "Tweet" button should still be enabled because the "Add Photo" button is ON, but this isn't the case.

This means that our input handler for `textarea` is missing some logic. To fix this, **we need to add another condition to the `if` statement in the input handler**.

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  ...
  if ($(this).val().length > 0 || $(".js-add-photo-button").hasClass("is-on")) {
    ...
  } else {
    ...
  }
});
```

We add the following check to whether or not the button should be disabled:

- When the text changes, if the "Add Photo" button is ON, do not disable the button.

**Try the above steps again** and this time it won't break.

## Step 11: Reflection on the jQuery Code - Why So Confusing? (5 minutes)

Here's the final HTML and JS code from the previous step:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/xupice/2/embed?html,js">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/xupice/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

**Take a look at the jQuery code once again**. It's very confusing. If you're keeping the code as-is, you'll probably need some comments so you remember what you did. There are clear signs of duplication, but you have to think a bit on how to refactor.

The question is: **why did it get so ugly so fast?**

And the answer has to do with the **"jQuery style"** of code we talked about previously. Recall this diagram:

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-1.png)

This is simple when there are only 1 event handler and 1 DOM. However, like we just saw, **if several event handlers are modifying several parts of the DOM, the code gets ugly.**

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-2.png)

Imagine adding some more features that could influence both the character limit and the "Tweet" button state. The above diagram will have even more arrows. And the code would become unmanageable.

You can, in theory, mitigate this by refactoring into reusable functions. But you'd still have to think hard about it every time you add something new. (Update: Someone from Hacker News sent me the [refactored jQuery code](http://pastebin.com/wbGZZs7U). Very clean but again, it requires some thinking.)

Now, let's see how it's like to do the same thing in React. **Hint: It's going to be much simpler.**

## Step 12: The "Add Photo" Button, in React (10-20 minutes)

Start with our previous React implementation.

 <div class="message"><strong>✔ Click "Save" below</strong> to copy the code to your JSBin and get started.</div>

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/lizoco/3/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/lizoco/3/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

(**Tip**: Since you won't be touching HTML in React, **you can close the HTML tab on JSBin** so you can get more screen space).

### Adding the Button

First, let's add the "Add Photo" button. **Modify the JSX**:

```
<button ...>Tweet</button>
<button className="btn btn-default pull-right">Add Photo</button>
```

Now, **let's add a click handler** to this button so that the text changes from `Add Photo` to `✓ Photo Added`. Recall the React style of writing code:

![](/images/labs/react-style-2.png)

We will:

1. **Create a state variable** that keeps track of whether the "Add Photo" button is ON or OFF.
2. **Use the state** on `render()` to decide whether to show `Add Photo` or `✓ Photo Added`.
3. **Modify the state** on the click handler.

For (1), **we'll modify `getInitialState`** and add a key-value pair in the state to keep track of whether the photo is added or not:

```
getInitialState: function() {
  return {
    text: "",
    photoAdded: false
  };
},
```

For (2), **we'll modify the JSX markup** for the "Add Photo" button. We'll have the button say "Photo Added" if `this.state.photoAdded` is true. We can just use a ternary expression here.

```
<button className="btn btn-default pull-right">
  {this.state.photoAdded ? "✓ Photo Added" : "Add Photo" }
</button>
```

Finally, for (3), **we'll attach a click handler on JSX** like we did for `textarea`:

```
<button className="btn btn-default pull-right"
  onClick={this.togglePhoto}>
  {this.state.photoAdded ? "✓ Photo Added" : "Add Photo" }
</button>
```

And **add a handler method which reverses `this.state.photoAdded`**:

```
togglePhoto: function(event) {
  this.setState({ photoAdded: !this.state.photoAdded });
},
```

Now, clicking on `Add Photo` should toggle the text. **Try it out yourself**.

### Decrement Character Count

We'll now implement the next feature:

- If the "Add Photo" button is ON, **the number of available characters decreases by 23.**

Currently, the number of available characters is displayed as follows in `render()`:

```
<span>{140 - this.state.text.length}</span>
```

This will now also depend on `this.state.photoAdded`, so we need an `if` and `else` here.

However, **in JSX, you can't write `if` or `else` inside `{ ... }`**. You can use a ternary expression (`a ? b : c`) like we did before, but that would be pretty long in this case.

Usually the simplest way in this situation is to refactor a conditional into a method. Let's try it.

**First, modify the above code to use a method, like this**:

```
<span>{ this.remainingCharacters() }</span>
```

**And define the method like this:**

```
remainingCharacters: function() {
  if (this.state.photoAdded) {
    return 140 - 23 - this.state.text.length;
  } else {
    return 140 - this.state.text.length;
  }
},
```

Now, the remaining character count should update accordingly when the "Add Photo" button is toggled.

**Question**: In `render()`, why does `{ this.remainingCharacters() }` have `()` but `{ this.handleChange }` and `{ this.togglePhoto }` don't?

Good question. Let's take a look at `render()` again:

```
render: function() {
  return (
    ...
      <textarea className="..."
                onChange={ this.handleChange }></textarea>
      ...
      <span>{ this.remainingCharacters() }</span>
      ...
      <button className="..."
        onClick={ this.togglePhoto }>
        ...
      </button>
    </div>
  );
```

**Answer**:

- We've written `remainingCharacters()` method to **return a number**. We need to get this number and put it in between `<span></span>`, so we need to **call** `remainingCharacters()` method by using `()`. That's why there's `()` in `remainingCharacters()`.
- On the other hand, `handleChange` and `togglePhoto` are **event handlers**. We want these methods to be called only when the user interacts with the UI (changing the text or clicking the button). To do so, in `render()`, we need to write them without `()` and assign them to attributes like `onChange` and `onClick`.

### The "Tweet" Button's States

We've got one more feature to implement:

- If the "Add Photo" button is ON, **even if there's no text entered, the "Tweet" button remains enabled.**

This is actually really easy to do. Previously, the Tweet button's `disabled` option was set as:

```
<button ... disabled={this.state.text.length === 0}>...</button>
```

In other words, previously the "Tweet" button was disabled if the text's length was 0. **Now, the "Tweet" button is disabled if**:

- The text's length is 0, **and**:
- The "Add Photo" button is OFF.

So the logic becomes like this:

```
<button ... disabled={this.state.text.length === 0 && !this.state.photoAdded}>...</button>
```

Or, you can simplify the above code by utilizing `remainingCharacters()`. If there are 140 characters remaining, that means that no text is entered and that the "Add Photo" button is OFF, so the "Tweet" button should be disabled.

```
<button ... disabled={this.remainingCharacters() === 140}>...</button>
```

That's it! Try toggling the "Add Photo" button and check that the "Tweet Button" is enabled/disabled correctly.

### We're Done!

That was easy. Here's the resulting JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/fitiha/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/fitiha/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

## Step 13: Reflection on the React Code - Why So Simple? (5 minutes)

The changes to accommodate the "Add Photo" button were minimal when using React. No refactoring needed. Why is this the case?

Again, it has to do with React's style of writing UI code. In React, event handlers modify the "state", and whenever the state is modified, React automatically calls `render()` again to update the UI.

![](/images/labs/react-style-2.png)

In this particular example, the diagram now looks like this:

![](/images/labs/react-style-3.png)

The state becomes an intermediary thing which sits in between the event handlers and `render()`:

- Event handlers don't need to worry about which part of the DOM changes. They just need to set the state.
- Similarly, when you write `render()`, all you need to worry about is what the current `state` is.

### Compare with jQuery

You can imagine what would happen as the UI gets more features. Without the intermediary "state", we'd have a tough time managing complexity. This is why you'd want to use React over jQuery for complex UIs.

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-vs-react-style.png)

Again, **it's possible** to write clean jQuery code that doesn't look like spaghetti. But you have to come up with the code structure yourself and think about how to refactor every time you add a new feature. React provides you this structure and reduces your cognitive load.

## Step 14: The Final Feature - Highlighting Overflown Characters (5 minutes)

The last feature we're going to implement is **highlighting characters that are over the limit**.

![](/images/labs/overflow-highlight.png)

Unfortunately, **we're not going to highlight the actual text inside the Tweet box**, because that would require us to change `textarea` to `contenteditable`, and `contenteditable` is a bit too complicated for illustrative purposes.

Instead, **we'll be displaying an alert box** on top and indicate which characters need to be deleted, like this:

![](/images/labs/overflow-highlight-alert.png)

**To try it out, copy the following quote by Steve Jobs:**

> If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

**And paste it into the Tweet box below:**

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/kuveba/3/embed?output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a> <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/kuveba/3/edit">Click here</a>.</span>


- It should show an alert box with the overflown characters highlighted in red
- It should also show 10 characters before the cutoff point, without any highlighting.

If we were to implement this in jQuery, our code will be even messier. Notice in the diagram that we'll be adding two more arrows for one new feature.

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-3.png)

**So we're not going to implement this in jQuery**. We'll just do it in React and call it a day. It'd be pretty simple to do in React - just one extra arrow on the diagram:

![](/images/labs/react-style-4.png)

## Step 15: Highlighting Overflown Characters in React (10 - 15 minutes)

Start with our previous React implementation.

<div class="message"><strong>✔ Click "Save" below</strong> to copy the code to your JSBin and get started.</div>

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/fitiha/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/fitiha/2/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

We'll do this step by step. First, **we'll display a simple alert when you write past the limit.** The alert will have some static text.

![](/images/labs/overflow-highlight-react-1.png)

Since this will require a conditional, let's write it in a separate method. **Add `{ this.overflowAlert() }` in front of the text box:**

```
{ this.overflowAlert() }
<textarea className="form-control"
          onChange={this.handleChange}></textarea>
```

Now, this method should return:

- **A div tag** for the alert box if there are no more characters left.
- **Nothing** (i.e. empty text) otherwise.

It turns out that in React, **you can return JSX markup from a method and use this in some other method**, everything will just work. In other words, you can do something like:

```
someMethod: function() {
  return (
    <a href="#">Hello World</a>
  );
},
someMethod2: function() {
  return (
    <h1>
      { this.someMethod() }
    </h1>
  );
},
```

In our case, we can return `( <div> ... </div> )` on one condition, and nothing on the other. **So our `overflowAlert` method will look like this:**

```
overflowAlert: function() {
  if (this.remainingCharacters() < 0) {
    return (
      <div className="alert alert-warning">
        <strong>Oops! Too Long:</strong>
      </div>
    );
  } else {
    return "";
  }
},
```

Notice that we're checking `this.remainingCharacters()` to see if we should show the alert or not.

**Try this out by typing 140+ characters (or 117+ characters with the "Add Photo" button ON).** It should show the alert.

### Displaying Overflown Characters

Here's the breakdown of what goes inside the alert message:

![](/images/labs/overflow-highlight-react-2.png)

- Between "Oops! Too Long:" and the actual text, there's an empty single space followed by three dots. I used `&nbsp;` here because when writing markup in React, white spaces between tags get removed.
- Then there are the 131st~140th (total of 10) characters of `this.state.text`.
- Then there are the remaining characters highlighted in red.

**Let's write this in JSX. Inside the `if` clause of `overflowAlert`, we'll create two variables: `beforeOverflowText` and `overflowText`. We'll use `.substring()` method on `this.state.text`.**

```
if (this.remainingCharacters() < 0) {
  var beforeOverflowText = this.state.text.substring(140 - 10, 140);
  var overflowText = this.state.text.substring(140);

  return (
    <div className="alert alert-warning">
      <strong>Oops! Too Long:</strong>
      &nbsp;...{beforeOverflowText}
      <strong className="bg-danger">{overflowText}</strong>
    </div>
  );

- If you do `.substring(a, b)`, it will return `a + 1`th through `b`th characters from the string.
- If you do `.substring(a)`, it will return `a + 1`th through last characters from the string.
- We use Bootstrap's `bg-danger` class to highlight the text in red.

Copy paste this text again and see that the correct texts are highlighted. We're almost done!

### What if the "Add Photo" button is ON?

If the "Add Photo" button is ON then the character limit decreases by 23. **So our `beforeOverflowText` and `overflowText` need to take that into account:**

```
if (this.state.photoAdded) {
  var beforeOverflowText = this.state.text.substring(140 - 23 - 10, 140 - 23);
  var overflowText = this.state.text.substring(140 - 23);
} else {
  var beforeOverflowText = this.state.text.substring(140 - 10, 140);
  var overflowText = this.state.text.substring(140);
}
```

Now, try toggling the "Add Photo" button while entering any text that's longer than the limit. It should work correctly. Here's the JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/kuveba/3/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
  <span class="jsbin-not-loading-msg">JSBin not loading? <a target="_blank" href="http://jsbin.com/kuveba/3/edit">Click here</a>.</span>
</p>

That's it! Again, you can see that the code changes were simple:

## Step 16: What's Next? (5 minutes)

This concludes my tutorial. Hopefully you learned:

- The difference between jQuery code v.s. React code, and
- How to write some basic React code in JSX.

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-vs-react-style.png)

What's next? Well, I only covered one of the greatest features of React. The next thing you should learn is:

- How to compose React components, and
- `props`, which is more widely used than `state`.

Fortunately, [the official React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) is pretty good at explaining this. It might be pretty challenging if you don't know JS too well though.
