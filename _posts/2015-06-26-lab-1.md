Like the cow above, I also heard React.js was good and spent some time playing with it. Now that I'm pretty comfortable with React, I decided to write yet another tutorial on this subject.

## Target Audience: People Who Know Just Enough jQuery to Get by

Before I begin, I'd like to clarify who the target audience is.

Zed Shaw, the author of "[Learn Code the Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/)" series, recently wrote an excellent blog post called [Early v.s. Beginning Coders](http://zedshaw.com/2015/06/16/early-vs-beginning-coders/). In his post, Zed criticizes programming educators who claim that their materials are for "beginners", but in reality are incomprehensible for most "total" beginners.

I don't want to make a similar mistake here. Of people who have never tried out React, some are comfortable with frontend JS frameworks like [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/), [Ember](http://emberjs.com/), or [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/). Some know JavaScript pretty well. Some know just enough jQuery to get by. A tutorial that's effective for one group may not be optimal for the other groups.

In this tutorial, I'm targeting the third group I mentioned: **people who know just enough jQuery to get by**. Examples of people who might fit in this category would be:

- Designers who can do basic coding in HTML/CSS/jQuery.
- Wordpress developers who know how to use jQuery plugins.
- Beginning developers who have completed basic HTML/CSS/JS tutorials online.
- Backend developers who rely on Bootstrap and basic jQuery for their frontend needs.
- Anyone who does more copy-pasting than architecting when it comes to JavaScript.

If you're comfortable with JavaScript or any of the frontend frameworks, this tutorial is probably not for you, and you'll be very frustrated with my writing style. Otherwise, let's get started!

## Overview: We're Going to Build a "Tweet Box"

Many React.js tutorials begin by explaining how React works or why React is awesome. My tutorial will not.

Instead, we'll get right to building a simple UI, alternating between jQuery implementations and React.js implementations, explaining the differences along the way. The UI will resemble the Tweet box that you find on [Twitter](http://twitter.com):

![](/images/labs/tweet-box.png)

## Step 1: Introduction to JSBin

We'll be using [JSBin](http://jsbin.com/), an online HTML/CSS/JS editor which supports both jQuery and React.js code. You might be familiar with similar services like [CodePen](http://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) - they're all pretty similar, so I just decided to go with JSBin.

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/fisawa/2/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Try modifying the HTML on the left - i.e. change the button's text. You'll see the change on the right.

You can click "Save" on the menu to save changes on your JSBin account (after creating one). Once you're on the JSBin site, you can add a library to import things like Bootstrap.

![](/images/labs/add-library.png)

I then added (1) bootstrap (CSS only; removed JS), and (2) `btn btn-primary` classes on `<button>`, and the output is a little prettier:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/fisawa/5/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Now that you've seen some JSBins, llet's build out a tweet box. I've added a text field above the button. I've used some Bootstrap classes like `well`, `clearfix`, etc., but those are just for the looks and irrelevant for the tutorial.

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/1/embed?html,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

## Step 2: Implement the First Feature - Tweet Button Should Initially Be Disabled

Now, time for some JS. We'll first implement the following feature:

**Feature 1:** the "Tweet" button should initially be disabled. When there's at least one character in the text field, the "Tweet" button should be enabled.

Here's the demo. As you can see, the button is initially disabled. If you type something into the text box, the button becomes enabled.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/2/embed?output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

Now, here's the jQuery code that makes this happen. (Note that, on JSBin, you don't need to wrap your code inside `$(function() { ... });`.

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/3/edit?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Here's the explanation:

- I used the tag names, `button` and `textarea`, as selectors - no need to add IDs/classes for this trivial example.
- To enable/disable the button, use `$(...).prop(disabled, ...)`.
- To listen for the changes in `textarea`, use the `input` event, which works on modern browsers.

DO NOT PROCEED if this example was confusing to you. You should be more comfortable in jQuery before learning React.

Now that this feature is complete, we'll try to re-implement the same thing using React. This will take several steps.

## Step 3: The Tweet Box Using React.js

One of the first things you'll notice in React is that **you'll be writing the markup in JS, not in HTML**.

Let me show you what I mean. Here's the React.js code which displays the same Tweet box:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/6/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Some observations:

- Inside `return (...)` is HTML code, not JavaScript. In React, you'll write in the special syntax called JSX, which lets you put HTML inside JavaScript. Your browser does not understand JSX, so when React processes your JSX code, it automatically converts the HTML part inside JSX into valid JavaScript code so that the browser can understand it.
- The HTML code inside `return (...)` is pretty much identical to the HTML code from step 1.
- Try clicking on "HTML" on the above JSBin, and you'll see that there's no markup in HTML besides `<body></body>`. This is what I mean when I said **you'll be writing the markup in JS, not in HTML**.

Some questions you might have and answers to them:

**Question**: What does `React.createClass` and `React.render` do? Do I need to understand them now? <br>
**Answer**: Basically, `React.createClass` creates a piece of UI with a name (in this case, `TweetBox`). This then gets attached to the DOM through `React.render(<TweetBox />, document.body)` - meaning this UI is added inside the `body` tag. That's all you need to know for now.

**Question**: Do I need to do anything special to write JSX on my local machine?<br>
**Answer**: Yes, but that's outside the scope of this tutorial - in short, you need to import a [JSX transformer](http://facebook.github.io/react/downloads.html). That's not necessary on JSBin though. All you need to do to write JSX on JSBin is to (1) add a React library (the one without addons) and (2) select "JSX (React)" from the dropdown menu on the JS view.

**Question**: Isn't it a bad style to write markup (HTML) and behavior (JS) in the same place?<br>
**Answer**: It might be a bad style for simple web pages, but not necessarily so for large web applications. In large web applications, there will be hundreds of pieces of UI, each containing its own markup and behavior. The code will be more manageable if those markup and behavior are kept together for each piece of UI, as opposed to keeping "all markups" together and "all behaviors" together. And React is designed to develop large web applications. React was actually created and used by Facebook, one of the largest web applications ever.

**Question**: What's next?<br>
**Answer**: I'll show you how to write the above React code step-by-step.

## Step 4: Writing Your First React.js Code

I created a starter HTML file for you. Using "Add library," I've imported Bootstrap (removed JS) and React (without addons). **To follow along, click "Save" to copy this to your JSBin.**

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/notawe/1/embed?html">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

After saving to your JSBin, **open the JavaScript tab and select "JSX (React)"**:

![](/images/labs/select-jsx.png)

Now you're ready to write some React. **Try to follow along and type the following JS code snippets** on your JSBin.

```
var TweetBox = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
  }
});
```

This is the template for creating a piece of UI using React (in this case, a Tweet box). It's just as essential as `$(function() { ... })` on jQuery.

To actually construct the UI, we must fill in the `render` method. For now, let's keep it simple with just a single `div` tag.

```
var TweetBox = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    return (
      <div>
        Hello World!
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```

Like the above example, **put a pair of parenthesis `(...)` after `return`, and write the markup inside.**

### JSX Gotchas

There's one thing you need to remember with JSX - on `render`, there must be exactly **one** outer-most tag inside `return (...)`.

So the following doesn't work because there's zero outer-most tag:

```
return (
  Hello World!
);
```

This also doesn't work because there are two outer-most (`span`) tags inside `return (...)`:

```
return (
  <span>
    Hello
  </span>
  <span>
    World
  </span>
);
```

For the above example, the workaround is to create an extra tag which wraps the two `span` tags. I just used `div` here. This is a necessary evil when using React.

```
return (
  <div>
    <span>
      Hello
    </span>
    <span>
      World
    </span>
  </div>
);
```

### Attaching the UI to the DOM

Now we need to "attach" this UI to the DOM in order to see `Hello World`. **We will put it inside `body` by using `React.render`**:

```
var TweetBox = React.createClass({
  ...
});

React.render(
  <TweetBox />,
  document.body
);
```

`React.render` takes two arguments. The first argument is the UI object, which is `<VariableName />`. The second argument is the DOM object.

Now, you should see `Hello World` appear on your JSBin. Congratulations, you wrote your first React UI!

### Write the Actual HTML for the Tweet Box

Now, instead of `Hello World`, we'll implement the HTML for the Tweet Box. **Swap the contents of `render` with this:**

```
return (
  <div className="well clearfix">
    <textarea className="form-control"></textarea>
    <br/>
    <button className="btn btn-primary pull-right">Tweet</button>
  </div>
);
```

There are two things you need to watch out for:

- **Do not use `class`**. Instead, use `className`. It's because JSX gets translated to JS, and `class` is a keyword in the newest version of JS.
- **If you use `<br>` instead of `<br/>`, it won't work.** Make sure to put `/` on self-closing tags.

Everything else should be the same with the jQuery example from before.

If you typed this correctly, then you should see the Tweet box on your JSBin. That's it for this step! Here's the JSBin up to this part:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/vajica/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

## Step 5: Re-implement the First Feature - Tweet Button Should Initially Be Disabled - in React

We're going to re-implement in React the first feature we implemented using jQuery:

**Feature 1**: the "Tweet" button should initially be disabled. When there's at least one character in the text field, the "Tweet" button should be enabled.

Here's the jQuery code we wrote:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/3/edit?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Let's see how we can do this in React.

**Start with the JSBin from step 4. First, let's disable the button by adding `disabled`.**

```
render: function() {
  return (
    ...
    <button className="..." disabled>Tweet</button>
    ...
  );
}
```

Then the button should now be disabled. Note that in our jQuery implementation we wrote:

```
$("button").prop("disabled", true);

```

to initially disable the button, but we could have instead modified the `button` tag like we did for our React implementation.

Now, we need to enable the button when there's at least one character in the text field.

### Handle Change Event

First, we need to wait when users enter the text. In our jQuery implementation, we wrote:

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  ...
}
```

In the React land, we write the event handler as a **method**. **Let's call it `handleChange`**:

```
React.createClass({
  handleChange: function(event) {
  },
  render: function() {
    ...
  }
});
```

Next, we invoke this handler when text is entered. To do so, **modify the `textarea` tag in `render()` like this**:

```
<textarea className="form-control"
          onChange={this.handleChange}></textarea>
```

- We used `input` event for jQuery, but in React we use `onChange` - you'll learn about these things from React's documentation, so don't worry too much now.
- **More importantly**, we use `{...}` syntax to include any JavaScript code inside the HTML syntax part of JSX. In this case, we want to pass the handler `handleChange`, and we prefix it with `this.` because it's a method on this UI object.
- If you're used to jQuery, this might seem like a bad practice, but don't worry. Again, in large applications, the code will be more manageable if those markup and behavior are kept together for each piece of UI.

To make sure that the handler is indeed being called, **let's use `console.log`**:

```
handleChange: function(event) {
  console.log(event.target.value);
},
```

The `event` object contains `target`, which is the `textarea`. We use `.value` on it to output the current value of the `textarea`.

**In your JSBin, open the `console` tab to check the output. Then type something on the Tweet box.**

You can try it out here:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/kohudu/2/embed?javascript,console,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

That's it for this step! We'll finish this feature on the next step.

## Step 6: Implementing State

I'll now explain one of the biggest differences between jQuery-style code and React.js-style code.

In jQuery, when some event happens, you usually change the DOM (like we did earlier):

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-1.png)

In React, **you don't directly modify the DOM**. Instead, in an event handler, you modify **the magic "state"**. Officially it's called just "state", but it's pretty magical so hence the name. And this is done by calling `this.setState`.

![](/images/labs/react-style-1.png)

Then, every time the magic "state" is updated, **`render` is called again**. And **inside `render` you can access the magic state**.

![](/images/labs/react-style-2.png)

This is how you update the UI in response to an event. Yes it's confusing, so let me explain using code.

### Writing the Event Handler

**Start with the JSBin from step 5.** First, we need to **initialize the magic "state" object**. To do this, we need to write a `getInitialState` method, and then have it return a JS object, which becomes the initial state.

What goes in the object? **Let's create a single key called `text`** and have it store whatever is inside the Tweet box.

```
var TweetBox = React.createClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {
      text: ""
    };
  },
  handleChange: ...
  render: ...
});
```

**Next, we'll modify the event handler** to set the state's `text` field to whatever is currently in the text box.

```
handleChange: function(event) {
  this.setState({ text: event.target.value });
},
```

Finally, in `render`, let's try to output the value of the `text` field in the state object. To do this, **simply use `this.state.text`, and use the `{ ... }` syntax** to call JS code inside the HTML syntax part of JSX.

```
<button ...>Tweet</button>
<br/>
{this.state.text}
```

**Now, try entering some text on the tweet box.** The same set of text should appear below the button.

Here's the JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/yabiqo/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Now the previous diagram might make more sense to you.

![](/images/labs/react-style-2.png)

### Enabling/Disabling the Button

Now that we can watch for the text changes, all that's left is to enable/disable the button depending on whether the text is entered.

Using the magic "state", we can use this logic:

- If `this.state.text.length === 0`, then the button should be disabled.

To do this in React, **add `disabled` attribute, and set it with the return value of `this.state.text.length == 0`**. Since this is a JS code, you need to wrap it with `{}`.

```
<button className="btn btn-primary pull-right"
        disabled={this.state.text.length === 0}>Tweet</button>
```

If you do `disabled="true"` or `disabled="false"` in raw HTML it won't work, but React is **not** raw HTML. It does the following magic:

- If you assign `{true}` to `disabled` in JSX, it gets converted to just `disabled` in HTML.
- If you assign `{false}`to `disabled` in JSX, the `disabled` attribute is removed.

This works with other boolean attributes like `checked`. How did I know this? [Googling](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/961), of course, but the official documentation should include it soon.

The resulting JSBin is here:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/lutefu/3/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

### Reflections

Again, keep this difference between jQuery and React in mind before moving onto the next step:

- In jQuery, you write event handlers which modify the **dom**.
- In React.js, you write event handlers which modify the **state**. And you write `render` to reflect the current state.

## Step 7: Remaining Character Count in jQuery

The next feature we'll implement is the remaining character count.

![](/images/labs/tweet-box-character-count.png)

Here's the spec:

- The character count will display `140 - the number of characters entered`.

Let's implement this in jQuery. Start with our previous jQuery implementation (**you can click "Save" below**).

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/wewimu/3/edit?html,js">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

First, **add character count in HTML using `span`**. Let's set it as `span`:

```
<textarea ...></textarea><br>
<span>140</span>
<button ...>Tweet</button>
```

And inside the `input` handler, **add this code to update the character count**:

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  $("span").text(140 - $(this).val().length);
  ...
});
```

That's it! Try typing in the Tweet box and you'll see the character count update. Here's the JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/durima/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

## Step 8: Remaining Character Count in React.js

How about in React? You should try doing this on your own. Start with our previous React implementation (**you can click "Save" below**).

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/lutefu/3/embed?html,js">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

**Hint**: use `this.state.text.length` in `render`.

### Answer:

Here's the JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/lizoco/3/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

And the answer is to add `<span>{140 - this.state.text.length}</span>` after `<br/>`.

Too easy? Not sure why React.js is so much better than jQuery? Well, the next step has more complexity, and this is when React.js really shines.

## Step 9: The "Add Photo" Button

This is when things get tricky. We'll add an "Add Photo" button to the UI.

![](/images/labs/tweet-box-add-photo.png)

However, **we will not actually let users upload photos.** Instead, here's what we're going to do.

When you upload a photo on Twitter, it counts against the number of characters you can use. On my attempt, it decreased the number of remaining characters from 140 to 117:

![](/images/labs/tweet-box-add-photo-explanation.png)

So that's what we're going to do. Here's the spec:

- Create an "Add Photo" button.
- Clicking this button toggles the ON/OFF state. **If it's ON, the button will say `✓ Photo Added`.**
- If this button is ON, **the number of available characters decreases by 23.**
- Also, if this button is ON, **even if there's no text entered, the "Tweet" button does not become disabled.**

Here's the demo JSBin. Try clicking the "Add Photo" button and see what happens to the character count and the Tweet button.

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/sanuqi/2/embed?output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

Let's implement this. We'll first try with jQuery.

## Step 10: The "Add Photo" Button, in jQuery

Start with our previous jQuery implementation (**you can click "Save" below**).

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/durima/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Next, we'll modify the HTML and JS. Before, we were attaching a handler to `$("button")`, but this won't work if there are two buttons. **So let's modify the HTML like this**:

```
...
<button class="js-tweet-button btn btn-primary pull-right" disabled>Tweet</button>
<button class="js-add-photo-button btn btn-default pull-right">Add Photo</button>
...
```

- I added the second button called "Add Photo".
- I added classes `js-tweet-button` and `js-add-photo-button` to each button.
- I added the `disabled` attribute to the Tweet button so I don't have to do this in JS.

**And modify the JS like this:**

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  $("span").text(140 - $(this).val().length);

  if ($(this).val().length > 0) {
    $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", false);
  } else {
    $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", true);
  }
});
```

- Since I added `disabled` attribute to the first button, I removed `$("button").prop("disabled", true);`.
- Replaced `$("button")` with `$(".js-tweet-button")`

### Adding the Button

Next, we'll implement one of the features:

- Clicking this button toggles the ON/OFF state. **If it's ON, the button will say `✓ Photo Added`.**

To do this, **let's add this piece of code**:

```
$(".js-add-photo-button").on("click", function() {
  if ($(this).hasClass("is-on")) {
    $(this)
      .removeClass("is-on")
      .text("Add Photo");
  } else {
    $(this)
      .addClass("is-on")
      .text("✓ Photo Added");
  }
});
```

We use the class `is-on` to keep track of the state. **Check to see that this works** by clicking the "Add Photo" button.

### Decrement Character Count

Next, we'll implement this feature:

- If the "Add Photo" button is ON, **the number of available characters decreases by 23.**

To do this, **first modify the code we just added like this**:

```
if ($(this).hasClass("is-on")) {
  $(this)
    .removeClass("is-on")
    .text("Add Photo");
  $("span").text(140 - $("textarea").val().length);
} else {
  $(this)
    .addClass("is-on")
    .text("✓ Photo Added");
  $("span").text(140 - 23 - $("textarea").val().length);
}
```

**Check to see that this works** by clicking the "Add Photo" button.

### Fixing the Input Handler

This is not complete however - **if you have the "Add Photo" button ON and start typing on the text area, the remaining character count goes out of sync.**

To fix this, we also need to update the input handler:

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  if ($(".js-add-photo-button").hasClass("is-on")) {
    $("span").text(140 - 23 - $(this).val().length);
  } else {
    $("span").text(140 - $(this).val().length);
  }  

  ...
});
```

**Check to see that this works** by clicking the "Add Photo" button and typing some text.

### Implement the Final Feature

The last feature we need to implement is this:

- If the "Add Photo" button is ON, **even if there's no text entered, the "Tweet" button does not become disabled.**

To do this, **we need to modify the click handler of the "Add Photo" button:**

```
$(".js-add-photo-button").on("click", function() {
  if ($(this).hasClass("is-on")) {
    ...
    if ($("textarea").val().length === 0) {
      $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", true);
    }
  } else {
    ...
    $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", false);
  }
});
```

- If the "Add Photo" button is going from ON to OFF (`if` clause), we need to check if there's no text entered and if so, disable the "Tweet" button.
- If the "Add Photo" button is going from OFF to ON (`else` clause), we always enable the "Tweet" button.

**However, we're not done**. The following steps will break the code:

- Turn on the "Add Photo" button.
- Type some text.
- Delete all of the text.
- The "Tweet" button should still be enabled because the "Add Photo" button is ON, but this isn't the case.

To fix this, **we need to add another condition to the `if` statement in the input handler**.

```
$("textarea").on("input", function() {
  ...
  if ($(this).val().length > 0 || $(".js-add-photo-button").hasClass("is-on")) {
    $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", false);
  } else {
    $(".js-tweet-button").prop("disabled", true);
  }
});
```

- When the text changes, if the "Add Photo" button is ON, do not disable the button.

Try it again and this time it won't break.

## Step 11: Reflection on the jQuery Code - Why So Confusing?

Here's the final HTML and JS code from the previous step:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/xupice/2/embed?html,js">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

Just take a look at the jQuery code. It's very confusing. If you're keeping the code as-is, you'll probably need some comments so you remember what you did. There are clear signs of duplication, but you have to think a bit on how to refactor.

The question is: **why did it get so ugly so fast?**

And the answer has to do with the **"jQuery style"** of code we talked about previously. Recall this diagram:

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-1.png)

This is simple when there are only 1 event handler and 1 DOM. However, like we just saw, **if several event handlers are modifying several parts of the DOM, the code gets ugly.**

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-2.png)

Imagine adding some more features that could influence both the character limit and the "Tweet" button state. The above diagram will have even more arrows. And the code would become unmanageable.

You can, in theory, mitigate this by refactoring into reusable functions. But you'd still have to think hard about it every time you add something new.

Now, let's see how it's like to do the same thing in React. **Hint: It's going to be much simpler.**

## Step 12: The "Add Photo" Button, in React

Start with our previous React implementation (**you can click "Save" below**).

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/lizoco/3/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

### Adding the Button

First, let's add the "Add Photo" button. **Modify the JSX**:

```
<button ...>Tweet</button>
<button className="btn btn-default pull-right">Add Photo</button>
```

Now, **let's add a click handler** to this button so that the text changes from `Add Photo` to `✓ Photo Added`. Recall the React style of writing code

![](/images/labs/react-style-2.png)

We will:

1. **Create a state variable** that keeps track of whether the "Add Photo" button is ON or OFF.
2. **Use the state** on `render()` to decide whether to show `Add Photo` or `✓ Photo Added`.
3. **Modify the state** on the click handler.

For (1), **we'll modify `getInitialState`** and add a variable in the state to keep track of whether the photo is added or not:

```
getInitialState: function() {
  return {
    text: "",
    photoAdded: false
  };
},
```

For (2), **we'll modify the JSX markup** for the "Add Photo" button:

```
<button className="btn btn-default pull-right">
  {this.state.photoAdded ? "✓ Photo Added" : "Add Photo" }
</button>
```

Finally, for (3), **we'll attach a click handler on JSX** like we did for `textarea`:

```
<button className="btn btn-default pull-right"
  onClick={this.togglePhoto}>
  {this.state.photoAdded ? "✓ Photo Added" : "Add Photo" }
</button>
```

And **add a handler method which reverses `this.state.photoAdded`**:

```
togglePhoto: function(event) {
  this.setState({ photoAdded: !this.state.photoAdded });
},
```

Now, clicking on `Add Photo` should toggle the text.

### Decrement Character Count

We'll now implement the next feature:

- If the "Add Photo" button is ON, **the number of available characters decreases by 23.**

Currently, the number of available characters is displayed as follows in `render()`:

```
<span>{140 - this.state.text.length}</span>
```

This will now also depend on `this.state.photoAdded`, so we need an `if` and `else` here.

However, **in JSX, you can't write `if` or `else` inside `{ ... }` in the markup**. You can use [a ternary expression](https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/if-else-in-JSX.html), but that could be cumbersome.

Usually the simplest way is to refactor a conditional into a function. Let's do it here - **first, modify the above code like this**:

```
<span>{ this.remainingCharacters() }</span>
```

And define the method like this:

```
remainingCharacters: function() {
  if (this.state.photoAdded) {
    return 140 - 23 - this.state.text.length;
  } else {
    return 140 - this.state.text.length;
  }
},
```

Now, the remaining character count should update accordingly when the "Add Photo" button is toggled.

You might be wondering: **why does `this.remainingCharacters()` have `()` but `this.handleChange` and `this.togglePhoto` don't?**

**Answer**: For `this.remainingCharacters`, you need to **call** this method in `render()` to display the correct character count. That's why it has `()`.

On the other hand, you **don't** want to actually call the event handler methods in `render()` - that's why `this.handleChange` and `this.togglePhoto` don't have `()`.

### The "Tweet" Button's States

We've got one more feature to implement:

- If the "Add Photo" button is ON, **even if there's no text entered, the "Tweet" button does not become disabled.**

This is actually really easy to do. Previously, the Tweet button's `disabled` option was set as:

```
<button ... disabled={this.state.text.length === 0}>...</button>
```

In other words, the button was disabled if the text's length was 0. We need to update this to: the button is disabled if:

- The text's length is 0, **and**:
- The "Add Photo" button is OFF.

So the logic becomes like this:

```
<button ... disabled={this.state.text.length === 0 && !this.state.photoAdded}>...</button>
```

That's it! Try toggling the "Add Photo" button and check that the "Tweet Button" is enabled/disabled correctly.

### We're Done!

That was easy. Here's the resulting JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/fitiha/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

## Step 13: Reflection on the React Code - Why So Simple?

The changes to accommodate the "Add Photo" button were minimal when using React. No refactoring needed. Why is this the case?

Again, it has to do with React's style of writing UI code. The diagram now looks like this:

![](/images/labs/react-style-3.png)

The state becomes an intermediary thing which sits in between the event handlers and `render()`:

- Event handlers don't need to worry about which part of the DOM changes. They just need to set the state.
- Similarly, when you write `render()`, all you need to worry about is what the current `state` is.

### Compare with jQuery

You can imagine what would happen as the UI gets more features. Without the intermediary "state", we'd have a tough time managing complexity. This is why you'd want to use React over jQuery for complex UIs.

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-vs-react-style.png)

## Step 14: The Final Feature - Highlighting Overflown Characters

The last feature we're going to implement is **highlighting characters that are over the limit**.

![](/images/labs/overflow-highlight.png)

Unfortunately, **we're not going to highlight the actual text inside the Tweet box**, because that would require us to change `textarea` to `contenteditable`, and it could be pretty challenging to manage.

Instead, **we'll be displaying an alert box** on top and indicate which characters need to be deleted. To try it out, copy the following quote by Steve Jobs:

> If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

And paste it into the Tweet box below:

<a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/kuveba/3/embed?output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>

- It should show an alert box with the overflown characters highlighted in red
- It should also show 10 characters before the cutoff point, without any highlighting.

If we were to implement this in jQuery, our code will be even messier. Notice in the diagram that we'll be adding two more arrows for one feature.

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-3.png)

**So we're not going to implement this in jQuery**. We'll just do it in React and call it a day. It'd be pretty simple to do in React - just one extra arrow on the diagram:

![](/images/labs/react-style-4.png)

## Step 15: Highlighting Overflown Characters in React

Start with our previous React implementation (**you can click "Save" below**).

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/fitiha/2/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

We'll do this step by step. First, **we'll display a simple alert when you write past the limit.** The alert will have some static text.

![](/images/labs/overflow-highlight-react-1.png)

Since this will require a conditional, let's write it in a separate method. **Add `{ this.overflowAlert() }` in front of the text box:**

```
{ this.overflowAlert() }
<textarea className="form-control"
          onChange={this.handleChange}></textarea>
```

Now, this method should return:

- **A div tag** for the alert box if there are no more characters left.
- **Nothing** (i.e. empty text) otherwise.

It turns out that in React, **you can return JSX markup from a method and use this in some other method**, everything will just work. In other words, you can do something like:

```
someMethod: function() {
  return (
    <a href="#">Hello World</a>
  );
},
someMethod2: function() {
  return (
    <h1>
      { this.someMethod() }
    </h1>
  );
},
```

In our case, we can return `( <div> ... </div> )` on one condition, and nothing on the other. **So our `overflowAlert` method will look like this:**

```
overflowAlert: function() {
  if (this.remainingCharacters() < 0) {
    return (
      <div className="alert alert-warning">
        <strong>Oops! Too Long:</strong>
      </div>
    );
  } else {
    return "";
  }
},
```

Notice that we're checking `this.remainingCharacters()` to see if we should show the alert or not.

Now try this out by typing over 140 characters (or 130 characters with the "Add Photo" button ON). It should show the alert.

### Displaying Overflown Characters

Here's the breakdown of what goes inside the alert message:

![](/images/labs/overflow-highlight-react-2.png)

- Between "Oops! Too Long:" and the actual text, there's an empty single space followed by three dots. I used `&nbsp;` here because when writing markup in React, white spaces between tags get removed.
- Then there are the 131st~140th (total of 10) characters of `this.state.text`.
- Then there are the remaining characters highlighted in red.

**Let's write this in JSX.** We'll create two variables: `beforeOverflowText` and `overflowText`. We'll use `.substring()` method on `this.state.text`:

```
var beforeOverflowText = this.state.text.substring(140 - 10, 140);
var overflowText = this.state.text.substring(140);

return (
  <div className="alert alert-warning">
    <strong>Oops! Too Long:</strong>
    &nbsp;...{beforeOverflowText}
    <strong className="bg-danger">{overflowText}</strong>
  </div>
);
```

- If you do `.substring(a, b)`, it will return `a + 1`th through `b`th characters from the string.
- If you do `.substring(a)`, it will return `a + 1`th through last characters from the string.
- We use Bootstrap's `bg-danger` class to highlight the text in red.

Copy paste this text again and see that the correct texts are highlighted. We're almost done!

> If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on.

### What if the "Add Photo" button is ON?

If the "Add Photo" button is ON then the character limit decreases by 23. **So our `beforeOverflowText` and `overflowText` need to take that into account:**

```
if (this.state.photoAdded) {
  var beforeOverflowText = this.state.text.substring(140 - 23 - 10, 140 - 23);
  var overflowText = this.state.text.substring(140 - 23);
} else {
  var beforeOverflowText = this.state.text.substring(140 - 10, 140);
  var overflowText = this.state.text.substring(140);
}
```

Now, try toggling the "Add Photo" button while entering any text that's longer than the limit. It should work correctly. Here's the JSBin:

<p class="jsbin-wrapper">
  <a class="jsbin-embed" href="http://jsbin.com/kuveba/3/embed?js,output">JS Bin on jsbin.com</a>
</p>

That's it! Again, you can see that the code changes were simple:

## Step 16: What's Next?

This concludes my tutorial. Hopefully you learned:

- The difference between jQuery code v.s. React code, and
- How to write some basic React code in JSX.

![](/images/labs/jquery-style-vs-react-style.png)

What's next? Well, I only covered one of the greatest features of React. The next thing you should learn is:

- How to compose React components, and
- `props`, which is more widely used than `state`.

Fortunately, [the official React tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html) is pretty good at explaining this. It might be pretty challenging if you don't know JS too well though.
